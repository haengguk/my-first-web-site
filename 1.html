    <p><strong><u>These days,</u></strong> with the world getting colder,
    She spends more time sleeping over
    Than I planned.
    Tonight we're gonna order in,
    Drinking wine and watchin' CNN.
    It's dark I know, but then again
    It's the brightest thing I got
    </p><p

        'Cause I'm covered in rain
        No, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
        Fireworks to fireplaces
        Summer stole what fall replaces
        We're people watching, all the people watching, everybody watching me
        Standing by the missing signs at the CVS by the checkout line
        She puts her quiet hands in mine
        'Cause she's the brightest thing I got
        When I'm covered in rain
        'Cause I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
        'Cause I'm covered in rain
        No I'm covered in rain
        It's alright
        If you don't want to, go on
        It's alright
        If you don't want to, be alone
        Oh It's alright
        If you don't want to, want to, want to, go home
        I understand, I understand, I understand,
        You and me and everyone
        I'm covered in rain
        No, I'm covered in rain
        No, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
        I'm covered in, covered in, covered in rain
    </p>
