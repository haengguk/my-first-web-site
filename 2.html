    <p>  
        It's not a silly little moment
        It's not the storm before the calm
        This is the deep and dying breath of
        This love that we've been working on
        Can't seem to hold you like I want to
        So I can feel you in my arms
        Nobody's gonna come and save you
        We pulled too many false alarms
        We're going down
        And you can see it too
        We're going down
    </p>
    <p>
        And you know that we're doomed
        My dear
        We're slow dancing in a burning room
        I was the one you always dreamed of
        You were the one I tried to draw
        How dare you say it's nothing to me?
        Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
        I'll make the most of all the sadness
        You'll be a bitch because you can
        You try to hit me just to hurt me
        So you leave me feeling dirty
    </p>
